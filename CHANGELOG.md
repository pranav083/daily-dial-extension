# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
The version here always matches `manifest.json`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Open-source project scaffolding: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, issue and pull request templates.
- `PRIVACY.md` — the privacy policy the Chrome Web Store requires at a public
  URL.
- `docs/STORE_LISTING.md` — every field the Web Store submission asks for,
  written out, including permission justifications and review notes.
- Store graphics at Google's exact required sizes: three 1280×800 screenshots
  and 440×280 / 1400×560 promo tiles.
- GitHub Actions: CI runs lint, tests, and the version check on Node 20 and 22,
  plus a manifest job that fails if a referenced file is missing or if a network
  permission is ever added. A release workflow builds and attaches the zip on a
  version tag.
- `npm run check:version` — fails if `manifest.json`, `package.json`, and
  `CHANGELOG.md` disagree about the version, which otherwise drifts silently and
  gets a Web Store upload rejected.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-28

### Added

- **Undo** — <kbd>⌘Z</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd> reverts one stroke at a time, up
  to 30 deep. Entries are tagged with their date, so navigating between days
  can't drop a stroke onto the wrong one. "Clear day" is undoable too.
- Extension version is shown beside the wordmark.
- Unit tests (31) over the pure logic, using node's built-in test runner — no
  test framework dependency.
- ESLint config, `npm run check`, and a `package` script for producing a Web
  Store zip.
- README covering install, data handling, permissions, and layout.

### Changed

- Split all calculation out of `dial.js` into `lib.js` — geometry, stats, CSV,
  and reminder scheduling are now pure functions over plain data, shared between
  the page and the service worker, and covered by tests. `dial.js` keeps only
  DOM and storage work.
- Stored data now passes through validating `normalize*` functions on read;
  a malformed or hand-edited value falls back to a default instead of rendering
  a broken day.
- Reminder times are validated before being saved and scheduled.
- Storage write failures surface as a toast rather than failing silently.
- Pending reflection text is flushed on page unload instead of being lost.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-28

Initial version.

### Added

- 24-hour dial: click or drag around the ring to paint blocks of time, with a
  live "now" needle and per-block tooltips.
- Six categories, each with a colour and a weight (`+` productive, `·` neutral,
  `–` distraction). Rename, reweight, or hide them; days store the slot index so
  renaming never rewrites history.
- Daily read: tracked time, productive percentage, longest unbroken focus
  stretch, a weighted score with a plain-language summary, and a per-category
  breakdown including untracked time.
- Seven-day strip for spotting patterns; click any day to revisit or backfill it.
- A one-line "why" note per day.
- Two configurable daily reminders (off by default). The evening one reports how
  much of the day is still unlogged.
- CSV export — one row per block, shaped for a spreadsheet pivot, with a UTF-8
  BOM so Excel reads it correctly.
- Local-only storage: no account, no server, no analytics, and no host
  permissions. `tabs` is deliberately not requested.
